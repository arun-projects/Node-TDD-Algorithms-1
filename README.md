# Algorithms with TDD 1

In this lab we will develop a number of algorithms in JavaScript test-driven using Mocha and Chai. Your job is to write tests using Mocha-Chai first for the below use cases, and then write the code to make the tests pass.

- [Mocha documentation](https://mochajs.org/)
- [Chai documentation](http://chaijs.com/)

## Reverse a String

- Create a function that takes a string as an input and reverses it.

```
Sample Input: "hello"

Sample Output: "olleh"
```

## Find the Longest Word in a String

- Create a function that returns the length of the longest word in a given sentence.

```
Sample Input: "I had Japanese food for lunch"

Sample Output: 8
```

## Palindrome Check

- Create a function that returns true if the inputted string is a palindrome.

```
Sample Input: "Racecar"

Sample Output: true
```

## Group Array

- Write a function that takes in two parameters - an array, and the size of each group.
- Your function should split the given array into groups of a specified size provided by the second argument passed.
- Return the result as a two-dimensional array.

```
Sample Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Given size of group is 2:

Sample Output: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
```
